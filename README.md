 ##This repository will serve to implement the functionality of checking cards, more specifically, which out of two instantiated cards is 
 the winner.

 ###The "winning" is determined by the numbers and the suits.

 The suits are ordered from weakest to strongest as the following:

CLUBS, HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS

the numbers are ordered from weakest to strongest as the following:

4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3.
